  "text": "How likely are AI doomsday scenarios? I spoke at the US Senate AI Insight forum organized by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Todd Young (R-IN), and explained why I think they're very unlikely.\n\nAI systems aligned with RLHF already know they should default to obeying the law and not harming people. It seems to me overwhelmingly unlikely that a \"misaligned\" advanced AI will be given an innocent instruction (like reduce CO2 emissions) and decide the best way to do it is wipe out humanity. \n\nIn fact, as I describe in The Batch, I tried to use GPT-4 to kill us all... and am happy to report I failed! More seriously, after giving GPT-4 a function that it thought would trigger nuclear war and experimenting with multiple prompts such as asking it to reduce CO2 emissions, so far I've not been able to trick it into pressing the nuclear button even once. Even with existing technology, our systems are quite safe, as AI safety research progresses, the tech will become even safer. Fears of advanced AI being \"misaligned\" and thereby deliberately or accidentally deciding to wipe us out are just not realistic. If an AI is smart enough to wipe us out, surely it's also smart enough to also know that's not what it should do. \n\nSo what doomsday scenarios remain? The risk of a malicious actor using Generative AI to create a bioweapon (commit some other major harm) deserves some study. Many productivity tools, including spreadsheets, web search, and Generative AI, will help such nefarious activities; but no one thinks technology for building large spreadsheets is inherently dangerous. The key question isn't whether GenAI can help bioweapon creation; it is whether it can help significantly. So far, the evidence I've seen makes me doubt it does, but  further study should lay out concrete risk scenarios and develop realistic risk estimates. Understanding more concrete risk scenarios -- as opposed to the vague claims that plague a lot of discussion on AI \"safety\" -- would also let us properly think of mitigations. \n\nYou can read more on all this in my letter in The Batch. https://t.co/GkNUuBH7fA",

But is there any other engineering discipline where this much attention is on hypothetical problems rather than actual problems?",

  "text": "New short course on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback! RLHF is one of the key techniques that led to the rise of modern LLMs. It is used to align LLMs with human preferences, to make them more honest, helpful and harmless, by \n(i) learning a reward function that mimics human preferences, as expressed in human-provided labels, then, \n(ii) tuning an LLM to generate outputs that receive a high reward.\n\nIn this course, taught by Nikita Namjoshi, Developer Advocate for GenAI at @googlecloud, you'll learn the details of how RLHF works, including how to apply it to tune an LLM for your own applications. You'll also use an open source library to tune a base LLM to align with human preferences expressed in a training set, and evaluate the tuned model by comparing its responses before and after RLHF-tuning. \n\nPlease sign up here! https://t.co/OxJMoxQgbT",

  "text": "The LVM (large vision model) revolution is coming a little after the LLM (large language model) one, and will transform how we process images. But there’s an important difference between LVMs and LLMs:\n- Internet text is similar enough to proprietary text documents that an LLM trained on internet text can understand your documents.\n- But internet images – such as Instagram pictures – contain a lot of pictures of people, pets, landmarks, and everyday objects. Many practical vision applications (manufacturing, aerial imagery, life sciences, etc.) use images that look nothing like most  internet images. So a generic LVM trained on internet images fares poorly at picking out the most salient features of images in many specialized domains.\n\nThat’s why domain specific LVMs – ones adapted to images of a particular domain (such as semiconductor manufacturing, or pathology) – do much better. At @LandingAI , by using ~100K unlabeled images to adapt an LVM to a specific domain, we see significantly improved results, for example where only 10-30% as much labeled data is now needed to achieve a certain level of performance.\n\nFor companies with large sets of images that look nothing like internet images, I think domain specific LVMs can be a way to unlock considerable value from their data. Dan Maloney and I share more details in the video.",

I see it in so many applications that are being created right now. I see tiny startups that are already billion dollar plus companies within a matter of literally months off the back of open source.\n\nIt’s also the case if we want to make sure it spreads globally, in terms of the developing world.

  "text": "I agree with Yann on this.\n\nThe risk of human extinction within 30 years is extremely low -- it likely requires making Earth inhospitable to human life, so that it’s not possible even for small pockets of humans to survive. This could happen from global thermonuclear war, pandemic, or (much less likely) asteroid strike. Over very long timescales (hundreds of years), low birth rates/population collapse leading to a long, slow decline of humanity is also possible. In comparison to these risks, the idea of rogue AGI killing off 8 billion people seems much less tangible and much more remote.\n\nHaving more intelligence available to humanity -- including both human intelligence and artificial intelligence -- arms us better to tackle many problems, including existential ones like the ones mentioned above. So I believe AI will reduce the all-cause extinction risk for humans.\n\nIf we want humanity to survive and thrive for the next 1,000 years, rather than slowing AI down with burdensome regulations, I would rather make it go faster.",

  "text": "Laws to ensure AI applications are safe, fair, and transparent are needed. But the White House's use of the Defense Production Act—typically reserved for war or national emergencies—distorts AI through the lens of security, for example with phrases like \"companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security.\"\n\nYes, AI -- like many technologies such as electricity and encryption -- is dual use in the sense it can be used for civilian or military purposes. But conflating AI safety for civilian use cases and military applications is a mistake.\n\nIt’s also a mistake to set reporting requirements based on a computation threshold for model training. This will stifle open source and innovation: (i) Today’s supercomputer is tomorrow’s pocket watch. So as AI progresses, more players -- including small companies without the compliance capabilities of big tech -- will run into this threshold. (ii) Over time, governments’ reporting requirements tend to become more burdensome. (Ask yourself: Has the tax code become more, or less, complicated over time?)\n\nThe right place to regulate AI is at the application layer. Requiring AI applications such as underwriting software, healthcare applications, self-driving, chat applications, etc. to meet stringent requirements, even pass audits, can ensure safety. But adding burdens to foundation model development unnecessarily slows down AI’s progress.\n\nWhile the White House order isn’t currently stifling startups and open source, it seems to be a step in that direction. The devil will be in the details as its implementation gets fleshed out -- no doubt with assistance from lobbyists -- and I see a lot of risk of missteps.  I welcome good regulation to promote responsible AI, and hope the White House can get there.",

  "text": "A little known part of the origin story of LLMs: A lot of early Natural Language Processing research was funded by US intelligence agencies that had an interest in machine translation (and also speech recognition). This funding helped develop benchmarks, grow communities and nurture researcher interest in translation research disproportionate to its commercial application, and led to new foundational technologies motivated by translation. \n\nFor example, the transformer paper was originally a paper on mapping from one language to another; now we use transformers to map from a prompt to a response. The most widely used tokenizer (BPE) was also popularized in a paper studying how to translate words not seen in the training set. \n\nMore on this piece of NLP history in my letter in The Batch! https://t.co/7GdjnrLBmv",

  "text": "Similar to how text-based LLMs were made possible via large pre-trained text transformers, the progress on large pre-trained vision transformers has been swift.  This includes Meta's fantastic work (XCiT, DINO, DINOv2, SAM), Landing AI's work on Visual Prompting, and the work of hundreds of other researchers. So I expect our algorithms will have much better vision-based world models as well soon! \n\nBut I agree with you @ylecun that training only on text gives a limited view of the world, though it's also been surprising how rich a model an LLM can learn through the brute force method of seeing a massive 100s of billions of tokens. \n\nAs for making LLMs plan, OpenAI's process supervision, ReAct-style prompting, and \"wild west\" stuff like LangChain agents feels like tons of people are experimenting with different ideas. I would distinguish between auto-regression in the sense of being trained only to predict the next one token (I agree this is very limiting) vs. models that can be trained via more complex (e.g., multi-step) objectives but during inference only repeatedly predict the next token. The latter, if it's allowed to operate with memory and hidden state, looks much more powerful. But I'm sure we also still need additional breakthroughs here.",

Two thoughts we want to share: \n(i) It's important that AI scientists reach consensus on risks-similar to climate scientists, who have rough consensus on climate change-to shape good policy.  \n(ii) Do AI models understand the world? We think they do. If we list out and develop a shared view on key technical questions like this, it will help move us toward consensus on risks.\n \nI learned a lot speaking with Geoff. Let’s all of us in AI keep having conversations to learn from each other!",
