  "text": "Last night I taught nanochat d32 how to count 'r' in strawberry (or similar variations). I thought this would be a good/fun example of how to add capabilities to nanochat and I wrote up a full guide here:\nhttps://t.co/fz1AMI5kqk\n\nThis is done via a new synthetic task `SpellingBee`  that generates examples of a user asking for this kind of a problem, and an ideal solution from an assistant. We then midtrain/SFT finetune on these to endow the LLM with the capability, or further train with RL to make it more robust. There are many details to get right especially at smaller model sizes and the guide steps through them. As a brief overview:\n\n- You have to ensure diversity in user prompts/queries\n- For small models like nanochat especially, you have to be really careful with the tokenization details to make the task easy for an LLM. In particular, you have to be careful with whitespace, and then you have to spread the reasoning computation across many tokens of partial solution: first we standardize the word into quotes, then we spell it out (to break up tokens), then we iterate and keep an explicit counter, etc.\n- I am encouraging the model to solve the model in two separate ways: a manual way (mental arithmetic in its head) and also via tool use of the Python interpreter that nanochat has access to. This is a bit \"smoke and mirrors\" because every solution atm is \"clean\", with no mistakes. One could either adjust the task to simulate mistakes and demonstrate recoveries by example, or run RL. Most likely, a combination of both works best, where the former acts as the prior for the RL and gives it things to work with.\n\nIf nanochat was a much bigger model, you'd expect or hope for this capability to more easily \"pop out\" at some point. But because nanochat d32 \"brain\" is the size of a ~honeybee, if we want it to count r's in strawberry, we have to do it by over-representing it in the data, to encourage the model to learn it earlier. But it works! :)",

It's a bit subtle but by default LLMs have no inherent personality or any understanding of their own capabilities because they are not animal-like entities. They don't know what they are or what they can or can't do or know or don't know. All of it has to be explicit bolted on. This is done by asking a bigger LLM cousin to generate synthetic conversations (you tell it what they should look like simply in words), and then mixing them into midtraining and/or SFT stage. The most important challenge is ensuring enough entropy/diversity in your generated data. If you don't do it well, LLMs will generate 1000 conversations that are all ay too similar, even with high temperature. My script shows a crappy example of how to add diversity - e.g. by creating lists of starting messages or topics, sampling from them explicitly, adding them as fewshot examples into prompts for \"inspiration\", etc.\n\nI wanted to have some fun with it so nanochat now refers to me as King Andrej Karpathy (lol) just to illustrate that this is a giant blank canvas - you can infuse completely arbitrarily identity, knowledge or style into your LLM in this manner.

  "text": "There is nothing in principle preventing it, except that text is usually simply trained autoregressively for efficiency. I could imagine a midtraining stage where you fine tune with bidirectional attention for conditioning information, eg User messages (tokens where you won’t be asked to sample). I don’t know if this is done in practice. I mean, if you want to be really extra you could in principle bidirectional encode the entire context window just to predict the next single token. But doing this means you can’t parallelize training.\n\nBut I guess I agree that this aspect isn’t strictly speaking about pixels vs tokens. it’s a bit more that pixels are usually encoded while the tokens are usually decoded. (In the parlance of the original transformer paper)",

  "text": "I quite like the new DeepSeek-OCR paper. It's a good OCR model (maybe a bit worse than dots), and yes data collection etc., but anyway it doesn't matter.\n\nThe more interesting part for me (esp as a computer vision at heart who is temporarily masquerading as a natural language person) is whether pixels are better inputs to LLMs than text. Whether text tokens are wasteful and just terrible, at the input.\n\nMaybe it makes more sense that all inputs to LLMs should only ever be images. Even if you happen to have pure text input, maybe you'd prefer to render it and then feed that in:\n- more information compression (see paper) => shorter context windows, more efficiency\n- significantly more general information stream => not just text, but e.g. bold text, colored text, arbitrary images. \n- input can now be processed with bidirectional attention easily and as default, not autoregressive attention - a lot more powerful.\n- delete the tokenizer (at the input)!! I already ranted about how much I dislike the tokenizer. Tokenizers are ugly, separate, not end-to-end stage. It \"imports\" all the ugliness of Unicode, byte encodings, it inherits a lot of historical baggage, security/jailbreak risk (e.g. continuation bytes). It makes two characters that look identical to the eye look as two completely different tokens internally in the network. A smiling emoji looks like a weird token, not an... actual smiling face, pixels and all, and all the transfer learning that brings along. The tokenizer must go.\n\nOCR is just one of many useful vision -> text tasks. And text -> text tasks can be made to be vision ->text tasks. Not vice versa.\n\nSo many the User message is images, but the decoder (the Assistant response) remains  text. It's a lot less obvious how to output pixels realistically... or if you'd want to.\n\nNow I have to also fight the urge to side quest an image-input-only version of nanochat...",

  "text": "Nice, short post illustrating how simple text (discrete) diffusion can be.\n\nDiffusion (i.e. parallel, iterated denoising, top) is the pervasive generative paradigm in image/video, but autoregression (i.e. go left to right bottom) is the dominant paradigm in text. For audio I've seen a bit of both.\n\nA lot of diffusion papers look a bit dense but if you strip the mathematical formalism, you end up with simple baseline algorithms, e.g. something a lot closer to flow matching in continuous, or something like this in discrete. It's your vanilla transformer but with bi-directional attention, where you iteratively re-sample and re-mask all tokens in your \"tokens canvas\" based on a noise schedule until you get the final sample at the last step. (Bi-directional attention is a lot more powerful, and you get a lot stronger autoregressive language models if you train with it, unfortunately it makes training a lot more expensive because now you can't parallelize across sequence dim).\n\nSo autoregression is doing an `.append(token)` to the tokens canvas while only attending backwards, while diffusion is refreshing the entire token canvas with a `.setitem(idx, token)` while attending bidirectionally. Human thought naively feels a bit more like autoregression but it's hard to say that there aren't more diffusion-like components in some latent space of thought. It feels quite possible that you can further interpolate between them, or generalize them further. And it's a component of the LLM stack that still feels a bit fungible.\n\nNow I must resist the urge to side quest into training nanochat with diffusion.",

  "text": "My pleasure to come on Dwarkesh last week, I thought the questions and conversation were really good.\n\nI re-watched the pod just now too. First of all, yes I know, and I'm sorry that I speak so fast :). It's to my detriment because sometimes my speaking thread out-executes my thinking thread, so I think I botched a few explanations due to that, and sometimes I was also nervous that I'm going too much on a tangent or too deep into something relatively spurious. Anyway, a few notes/pointers:\n\nAGI timelines. My comments on AGI timelines looks to be the most trending part of the early response. This is the \"decade of agents\" is a reference to this earlier tweet https://t.co/NiSn6jftqq Basically my AI timelines are about 5-10X pessimistic w.r.t. what you'll find in your neighborhood SF AI house party or on your twitter timeline, but still quite optimistic w.r.t. a rising tide of AI deniers and skeptics. The apparent conflict is not: imo we simultaneously 1) saw a huge amount of progress in recent years with LLMs while 2) there is still a lot of work remaining (grunt work, integration work, sensors and actuators to the physical world, societal work, safety and security work (jailbreaks, poisoning, etc.)) and also research to get done before we have an entity that you'd prefer to hire over a person for an arbitrary job in the world. I think that overall, 10 years should otherwise be a very bullish timeline for AGI, it's only in contrast to present hype that it doesn't feel that way.\n\nAnimals vs Ghosts. My earlier writeup on Sutton's podcast https://t.co/rSp1noyGBr . I am suspicious that there is a single simple algorithm you can let loose on the world and it learns everything from scratch. If someone builds such a thing, I will be wrong and it will be the most incredible breakthrough in AI. In my mind, animals are not an example of this at all - they are prepackaged with a ton of intelligence by evolution and the learning they do is quite minimal overall (example: Zebra at birth). Putting our engineering hats on, we're not going to redo evolution. But with LLMs we have stumbled by an alternative approach to \"prepackage\" a ton of intelligence in a neural network - not by evolution, but by predicting the next token over the internet. This approach leads to a different kind of entity in the intelligence space. Distinct from animals, more like ghosts or spirits. But we can (and should) make them more animal like over time and in some ways that's what a lot of frontier work is about.\n\nOn RL. I've critiqued RL a few times already, e.g. https://t.co/mYrMFVdVDW . First, you're \"sucking supervision through a straw\", so I think the signal/flop is very bad. RL is also very noisy because a completion might have lots of errors that might get encourages (if you happen to stumble to the right answer), and conversely brilliant insight tokens that might get discouraged (if you happen to screw up later). Process supervision and LLM judges have issues too. I think we'll see alternative learning paradigms. I am long \"agentic interaction\" but short \"reinforcement learning\" https://t.co/2L7FiaoKsw. I've seen a number of papers pop up recently that are imo barking up the right tree along the lines of what I called \"system prompt learning\" https://t.co/df5mJDdN3C , but I think there is also a gap between ideas on arxiv and actual, at scale implementation at an LLM frontier lab that works in a general way. I am overall quite optimistic that we'll see good progress on this dimension of remaining work quite soon, and e.g. I'd even say ChatGPT memory and so on are primordial deployed examples of new learning paradigms.\n\nCognitive core. My earlier post on \"cognitive core\": https://t.co/q2s1ihGy0T , the idea of stripping down LLMs, of making it harder for them to memorize, or actively stripping away their memory, to make them better at generalization. Otherwise they lean too hard on what they've memorized. Humans can't memorize so easily, which now looks more like a feature than a bug by contrast. Maybe the inability to memorize is a kind of regularization. Also my post from a while back on how the trend in model size is \"backwards\" and why \"the models have to first get larger before they can get smaller\" https://t.co/6k0FZRGXsb\n\nTime travel to Yann LeCun 1989. This is the post that I did a very hasty/bad job of describing on the pod: https://t.co/fQgqaXPyp6 . Basically - how much could you improve Yann LeCun's results with the knowledge of 33 years of algorithmic progress? How constrained were the results by each of algorithms, data, and compute? Case study there of.\n\nnanochat. My end-to-end implementation of the ChatGPT training/inference pipeline (the bare essentials) https://t.co/SIetgyoKWN\n\nOn LLM agents. My critique of the industry is more in overshooting the tooling w.r.t. present capability. I live in what I view as an intermediate world where I want to collaborate with LLMs and where our pros/cons are matched up. The industry lives in a future where fully autonomous entities collaborate in parallel to write all the code and humans are useless. For example, I don't want an Agent that goes off for 20 minutes and comes back with 1,000 lines of code. I certainly don't feel ready to supervise a team of 10 of them. I'd like to go in chunks that I can keep in my head, where an LLM explains the code that it is writing. I'd like it to prove to me that what it did is correct, I want it to pull the API docs and show me that it used things correctly. I want it to make fewer assumptions and ask/collaborate with me when not sure about something. I want to learn along the way and become better as a programmer, not just get served mountains of code that I'm told works. I just think the tools should be more realistic w.r.t. their capability and how they fit into the industry today, and I fear that if this isn't done well we might end up with mountains of slop accumulating across software, and an increase in vulnerabilities, security breaches and etc. https://t.co/8556ESSpyY\n\nJob automation. How the radiologists are doing great https://t.co/FVUI872dkD and what jobs are more susceptible to automation and why.\n\nPhysics. Children should learn physics in early education not because they go on to do physics, but because it is the subject that best boots up a brain. Physicists are the intellectual embryonic stem cell https://t.co/p72Elk8lPV I have a longer post that has been half-written in my drafts for ~year, which I hope to finish soon.\n\nThanks again Dwarkesh for having me over!",

  "text": "nanochat d32, i.e. the depth 32 version that I specced for $1000, up from $100 has finished training after ~33 hours, and looks good. All the metrics go up quite a bit across pretraining, SFT and RL. CORE score of 0.31 is now well above GPT-2 at ~0.26. GSM8K went ~8% -> ~20%, etc. So that's encouraging.\n\nThe model is pretty fun to talk to, but judging from some early interactions I think people have a little bit too much expectation for these micro models. There is a reason that frontier LLM labs raise billions to train their models. nanochat models cost $100 - $1000 to train from scratch. The $100 nanochat is 1/1000th the size of GPT-3 in parameters, which came out 5 years ago. So I urge some perspective. Talking to micro models you have to imagine you're talking to a kindergarten child. They say cute things, wrong things, they are a bit confused, a bit naive, sometimes a little non-sensical, they hallucinate a ton (but it's amusing), etc.\n\nFull detail/report on this run is here:\nhttps://t.co/nWbfKOZLIg\nAnd I pushed the new script run1000 sh to the nanochat repo if anyone would like to reproduce. Totally understand if you'd like to spend $1000 on something else :D\n\nIf you like, I am currently hosting the model so you can talk to it on a webchat as you'd talk to ChatGPT. I'm not going to post the URL here because I'm afraid it will get crushed. You'll have to look for it if you care enough. I'm also attaching a few funny conversations I had with the model earlier into the image, just to give a sense.\n\nNext up, I am going to do one pass of tuning and optimizing the training throughput, then maybe return back to scaling and maybe training the next tier of a bigger model.",

You should think of micro models maybe more as very young children (kindergarten etc.), they just don't have the raw intelligence of their larger cousins. If you finetune/train it on your own data you'll probably get some amusing parroting that feels like your writing in style, but it will be slop.\n\nTo achieve what you're looking for you'd want something more like:\n- take your raw data\n- add extensive synthetic data generation rewrites on top (tricky, not obvious, researchy)\n- finetune a state of the art open LLM on it (e.g. tinker)\n- you'd possibly have to mix in a lot of pretraining data to not lose too much raw intelligence during finetuning.\nBasically I'd say getting this to work well is still realm of research and not obvious.\n\nYour best non-research bet is just giving all your writing to something like NotebookLM, which RAGs over it (i.e. references it in chunks). Your data makes it into context windows via RAG but doesn't impact the weights. So the model doesn't exactly \"know you\", but it's maybe the closest you can easily get.",

  "text": "Excited to release new repo: nanochat!\n(it's among the most unhinged I've written).\n\nUnlike my earlier similar repo nanoGPT which only covered pretraining, nanochat is a minimal, from scratch, full-stack training/inference pipeline of a simple ChatGPT clone in a single, dependency-minimal codebase. You boot up a cloud GPU box, run a single script and in as little as 4 hours later you can talk to your own LLM in a ChatGPT-like web UI.\n\nIt weighs ~8,000 lines of imo quite clean code to:\n\n- Train the tokenizer using a new Rust implementation\n- Pretrain a Transformer LLM on FineWeb, evaluate CORE score across a number of metrics\n- Midtrain on user-assistant conversations from SmolTalk, multiple choice questions, tool use.\n- SFT, evaluate the chat model on world knowledge multiple choice (ARC-E/C, MMLU), math (GSM8K), code (HumanEval)\n- RL the model optionally on GSM8K with \"GRPO\"\n- Efficient inference the model in an Engine with KV cache, simple prefill/decode, tool use (Python interpreter in a lightweight sandbox), talk to it over CLI or ChatGPT-like WebUI.\n- Write a single markdown report card, summarizing and gamifying the whole thing.\n\nEven for as low as ~$100 in cost (~4 hours on an 8XH100 node), you can train a little ChatGPT clone that you can kind of talk to, and which can write stories/poems, answer simple questions. About ~12 hours surpasses GPT-2 CORE metric. As you further scale up towards ~$1000 (~41.6 hours of training), it quickly becomes a lot more coherent and can solve simple math/code problems and take multiple choice tests. E.g. a depth 30 model trained for 24 hours (this is about equal to FLOPs of GPT-3 Small 125M and 1/1000th of GPT-3) gets into 40s on MMLU and 70s on ARC-Easy, 20s on GSM8K, etc.\n\nMy goal is to get the full \"strong baseline\" stack into one cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally forkable repo. nanochat will be the capstone project of LLM101n (which is still being developed). I think it also has potential to grow into a research harness, or a benchmark, similar to nanoGPT before it. It is by no means finished, tuned or optimized (actually I think there's likely quite a bit of low-hanging fruit), but I think it's at a place where the overall skeleton is ok enough that it can go up on GitHub where all the parts of it can be improved.\n\nLink to repo and a detailed walkthrough of the nanochat speedrun is in the reply.",
