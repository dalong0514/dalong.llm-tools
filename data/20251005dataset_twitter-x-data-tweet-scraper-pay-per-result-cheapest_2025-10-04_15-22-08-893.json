All of \"AI\" for *thinking* that you know and is currently developing will cerainly have useful applications, but will become deprecated. The \"correct\" approach by today's standards are impossible for you to work on. You first have to invent the Internet and make computers a lot faster. And not in a CPU way but in a GPU way. But a lot of computing for the rote/mechanical will indeed be incredibly useful - an extension of the human brain, in the way you imagine.\n3.

Indeed, all of us were excited when just two years ago with the release of Whisper. Imagine what Licklider would think of this reality.

Clearly, what Licklider has in mind feels something like a large multiplayer iPad. I feel like this is a major misprediction. Products like it have been made, but have not really taken off as the dominant computing paradigm. Instead, text was king for many decades after this article. Displays became dominant at the output, but keyboard and mouse (!) became dominant at the input, and mostly remain so today, 64 years later. The mobile computing era has changed that to touch, but not in the way that was imagined. Multiplayer visual environments like Licklider imagined do exist (e.g. Figma etc?), but they are nowhere near the dominant form of interaction. What is the source of this misprediction? I think Licklider took what he was familiar with (pencil and paper) and imagined computing as mirroring that interface. When a better interace was the keyboard and mouse, for both computers and people.",

Maybe programming languages can be made that function more natively in this way, hinting at the declarative programming paradigm (e.g. Prolog). However, the dominant programming paradigm paradigm today, 64 years later, has remained largely simple and imperative. Python may be one of the most popular programming languages today, and it is simply imperative (an \"improved FORTRAN\"), but very human-friendly, reading and writing similar to pseudo code.",

That said, some computations have also become so cheap that they moved to local consumer hardware, e.g. my laptop, capable of simple calculations, word processing, etc. Heavily underutilized, but it's okay.",

  "text": "An interesting observation from Licklider is that most of his \"thinking\" in a day-to-day computational task thought experiment is not so much thinking, but more a rote, mechanical, automatable data collection and visualization. It is this observation that leads him to conclude that the strengths and weaknesses of humans and computers are complementary; That computers can do the busy work, and humans can do thinking work. This has been the prevailing paradigm for the next 64 years, and it's only very recently (last ~year) that computers have started to make a dent into \"thinking\" in a general, scaleable, and economy-impacting way. Not in an explicit, hard, predicate logic way, but in an implicit, soft, statistical way. Hence the LLM-driven AI summer of today.",

  "text": "Licklider argues that the period of \"intelligence augmentation\" (IA) may be transient on the path to full automation (AI), but still long enough to be worth thinking through and about.\nHis citations for what must have felt like rapid progress in both narrow AI and AGI (of that age, i.e. the \"general problem solver\" [20]) are today known to be false starts that were off track in a quite fundamental way, at that time based on a manual process of encoding knowledge with predicate logic and using production rules of logic and search to manipulate them into conclusions. Today, most of AI is only aware of all of this work as a historical curiosity, it is not part of the \"master branch\" of the field, it is stuck in a dead end feature branch. And notably, what is considered today the most promising approach (LLMs) were at that time not only completely computationally inaccessible, but also impossible due to the lack of training data of trillions of tokens in digitized forms. (What might be an equivalent of that today?)\nThe study by the Air Force, estimating that machines alone would be doing problem solving of military significance in 20 years time evokes a snicker today. Amusingly, \"20 years away\" seems to be a kind of codeword for \"no idea, long time\". Arguably, I'm not sure that we are there even today, 64 years later. Computers do a lot to increase situational awareness, but decision making of \"military significance\" afaik is still well within the domain of human computation.",

  "text": "I do think your 3 tokens up above are only very briefly touching on a deep and unobvious insight, that a company training an LLM can, by the design of the architecture, shift resource spend between training and inference time. Resources like FLOPS, VRAM, code complexity. They can pay less resource at training time *at the expense* of a resource at inference time, in a way that improves capability. The first time this tension was on display was with the scaling laws/Chinchilla.\n\nSo as an LLM training company with finite compute, the question for the downstream users is do you want a 1) highest capability model, even if it means increased inference resource burden on your shoulders, or 2) the highest usability model but at a lower capability.\n\nYour original statement is that this release targets (1) while people just want (2), but the two are connected by a slider and it's ok to sweep it out. And it's also worth something to unlock higher capability (expanding the slider), even if it's more resource intesive to inference. The average r/LocalLlama person might not like it though :)",

  "text": "# On the \"hallucination problem\"\n\nI always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the \"hallucination problem\" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.\n\nWe direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.\n\nIt's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a \"hallucination\". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.\n\nAt the other end of the extreme consider a search engine. It takes the prompt and just returns one of the most similar \"training documents\" it has in its database, verbatim. You could say that this search engine has a \"creativity problem\" - it will never respond with something new. An LLM is 100% dreaming and has the hallucination problem. A search engine is 0% dreaming and has the creativity problem.\n\nAll that said, I realize that what people *actually* mean is they don't want an LLM Assistant (a product like ChatGPT etc.) to hallucinate. An LLM Assistant is a lot more complex system than just the LLM itself, even if one is at the heart of it. There are many ways to mitigate hallcuinations in these systems - using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to more strongly anchor the dreams in real data through in-context learning is maybe the most common one. Disagreements between multiple samples, reflection, verification chains. Decoding uncertainty from activations. Tool use. All an active and very interesting areas of research.\n\nTLDR I know I'm being super pedantic but the LLM has no \"hallucination problem\". Hallucination is not a bug, it is LLM's greatest feature. The LLM Assistant has a hallucination problem, and we should fix it.\n\n</rant> Okay I feel much better now :)",

  "text": "You know how image generation went from blurry 32x32 texture patches to high-resolution images that are difficult to distinguish from real in roughly a snap of a finger? The same is now happening along the time axis (extending to video) and the repercussions boggle the mind just a bit. Every human becomes a director of multi-modal dreams, like the architect in Inception.\n\nComing back to Earth for a second, image/video generation is a perfect match for data-hungry neural nets because data is plentiful, and the pixels of each image or video are a huge source of bits (soft constraints) on the parameters of the network. When you're training giant neural nets in supervision-rich settings, your train loss = validation loss, and life is so good.\n\nMy favorite place to keep an eye on the AI video space unfold atm is probably https://t.co/l1xRaq71C4 , or the individual Discords.",

  "text": "ChatGPT \"Advanced Data Analysis\" (which doesn't really have anything to do with data specifically) is an awesome tool for creating diagrams. I could probably code these diagrams myself, but it's soo much better to just sit back, and iterate in English.\n\nIn this example, I was experimenting with a possible diagram to explain Supervised Finetuning in LLMs. The \"document\" at the origin (0,0) is the empty document, and eminating outwards are token streams. Highlighted in black are the high probability  token streams of the base model. In red are the token streams corresponding to the conversational finetuning data. When we finetune, we are increasing the probabilities of the red paths and suppressing the black paths. I like this view because it emphasizes LLMs as \"token simulators\", with their own kind of statistical physics backed by datasets, bouncing around in the discrete token space.\n\nThe conversation where we built it in a few minutes:\nhttps://t.co/BPYipeQWws\n(Sadly I just remembered that ChatGPT sharing doesn't support images, but at least the text is there, of me iterating with the diagram in plain language, and needing to touch no code. Such a vibe of the future.)\n\nI had a similar experience yesterday, was trying to create a plot that shows smoothing in n-gram language models. Again I could just have coded this manually, but this was 10X faster and so easy.\n\nConversation:\nhttps://t.co/MTxD2YH6Kv\n\nPosting because during these chats I was struck again by that feeling of what must be the future, where you just sit back and say stuff, and the computer is doing the hard work. And in some narrow pockets of tasks, you can already get that feeling today.",

  "text": "With many üß© dropping recently, a more complete picture is emerging of LLMs not as a chatbot, but the kernel process of a new Operating System. E.g. today it orchestrates:\n\n- Input & Output across modalities (text, audio, vision)\n- Code interpreter, ability to write & run programs\n- Browser / internet access\n- Embeddings database for files and internal memory storage & retrieval\n\nA lot of computing concepts carry over. Currently we have single-threaded execution running at ~10Hz (tok/s) and enjoy looking at the assembly-level execution traces stream by. Concepts from computer security carry over, with attacks, defenses and emerging vulnerabilities.\n\nI also like the nearest neighbor analogy of \"Operating System\" because the industry is starting to shape up similar:\nWindows, OS X, and Linux <-> GPT, PaLM, Claude, and Llama/Mistral(?:)).\nAn OS comes with default apps but has an app store.\nMost apps can be adapted to multiple platforms.\n\nTLDR looking at LLMs as chatbots is the same as looking at early computers as calculators. We're seeing an emergence of a whole new computing paradigm, and it is very early.",

  "text": "Speculative execution for LLMs is an excellent inference-time optimization.\n\nIt hinges on the following unintuitive observation: forwarding an LLM on a single input token takes about as much time as forwarding an LLM on K input tokens in a batch (for larger K than you might think). This unintuitive fact is because sampling is heavily memory bound: most of the \"work\" is not doing compute, it is reading in the weights of the transformer from VRAM into on-chip cache for processing. So if you're going to do all that work of reading in all those weights, you might as well apply them to a whole batch of input vectors. I went into more detail in an earlier thread:\nhttps://t.co/Lbtpq4VDeY\n\nThe reason we can't naively use this fact to sample in chunks of K tokens at a time is that every N-th token depends on what token we sample at time at step N-1. There is a serial dependency, so the baseline implementation just goes one by one left to right.\n\nNow the clever idea is to use a small and cheap draft model to first generate a candidate sequence of K tokens - a \"draft\". Then we feed all of these together through the big model in a batch. This is almost as fast as feeding in just one token, per the above. Then we go from left to right over the logits predicted by the model and sample tokens. Any sample that agrees with the draft allows us to immediately skip forward to the next token. If there is a disagreement then we throw the draft away and eat the cost of doing some throwaway work (sampling the draft and the forward passing for all the later tokens).\n\nThe reason this works in practice is that most of the time the draft tokens get accepted, because they are easy, so even a much smaller draft model gets them. As these easy tokens get accepted, we skip through those parts in leaps. The hard tokens where the big model disagrees \"fall back\" to original speed, but actually a bit slower because of all the extra work.\n\nSo TLDR: this one weird trick works because LLMs are memory bound at inference time, in the \"batch size 1\" setting of sampling a single sequence of interest, that a large fraction of \"local LLM\" use cases fall into. And because most tokens are \"easy\".\n\nReferences\nhttps://t.co/sIBCSmsyKN\nhttps://t.co/uSpmTzfWhR\nhttps://t.co/7t7orHBybo",

  "text": "It's a good question. For a long time, looking at GPT with some envy at Tesla, I thought there would be equivalent pretraining objectives that require no human supervision. Maybe it's possible but a lot less trivial, or due to al lthe video data it requires a lot more compute. \n\nThe domains are also a bit different - language is a highly compressed high signal domain, and it's super cheap to handle. Video is very large and expensive to handle, and also the majority of the image data is completely useless - the trees, the bushes, the sky, the road texture. Only a very tiny portion of it really matters. In the extreme case, a little 5x5 patch of pixels near the vanishing point could be a car on the highway, but it's right next to an irrelent tree or building taking up 50% of the image.\n\nSo TLDR is it possible there can be unsupervised learning objectives that are just as effective? I think yes, but they need a lot bigger computers than we have today, and a lot more data. You have to \"power through\" all of the noise in the domain. Or you basically use humans to \"point out\" the parts that are important, and you can do it today.",

The fundamental problem is this: \"you changed a thing, did you net improve the system?\". Your speed of iteration is to a very large degree the speed with which you can answer this question. And if you have a fleet, you can answer this question a lot faster.\nFor both of these reasons separately I would expect the organization with larger fleet to be able to iterate a lot faster. So for me it's always been not so much about \"Lidar or not\", but \"fleet or not\".\nActually I'm also impressed with the progress from Waymo/Cruise/etc., and I see them driving around SF. I said before - I cheer for the team at Tesla the most obviously :), but I cheer for the industry as a whole, too. \nMy personal guess remains that Tesla has the right approach when you take the longer view beyond just SF, and that if we're talking about who actually gets to a serious, at-scale deployment of self-driving technology globally, it will be Tesla.",

E.g. the whole explicit stack might be alive and well but over time move to backend, used to 1) tune the data distribution and 2) modulate the loss function, and in this way get \"distiled\" into pure E2E test-time networks.

  "text": "Didn't expect real talk to drop from a bikini clad leeloo dallas\n- I always saw it as a gradual progression of Software 2.0 eating through the stack, as I showed in my talks.\n- I think starting from E2E is ineffective because the training signal is too few bits per input example. Video with O(~billion) pixels/s streams into a O(~billion) parameter network and you're getting just a few bits of supervision means you'll have to train your network for an impractical amount of time on impractically many examples. Supervised learning is a very effective source of useful bits. This pretrains your neural net so you can later finetune it with RL/E2E.\n- Even once you have E2E, imo any realistic self-driving car deployment will demand a vector space stack because sometimes you just want explicit control. E.g. if a regulator in some country comes to you with demands around time/distance for various maneuvers, you just want to be able to implement that.\n- A vector space stack gives you a valuable \"dictionary\" over scenes, which helps a ton with various data triggers, data science, etc., the ability to both source training data and analyze/evaluate the performance of the system. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's involved in also shaping the reward function for RL.\nFor these reasons I never saw the two at tension pulling in different directions. I saw the explicit vector space stack as a precondition to the E2E stack, and as something that will stick around, even if a lot of the driving gradually shifts to E2E mode. So the E2E project has been alive and well inside the team for a long time. Super exciting that it's actually starting to look quite capable.",

  "text": "Two notes I wanted to add:\n\n1) In addition to parallel inference and training, prompt encoding is also parallelizable even at batch_size=1 because the prompt tokens can be encoded by the LLM in parallel instead of decoded serially one by one. The token inputs into LLMs always have shape (B,T), batch by time. Parallel inference decoding is (high B, T=1), training is (high B, high T), and long prompts is (B=1, high T). So this workload can also become compute-bound (e.g. above 160 tokens) and the A100 would shine again. As your prompts get longer, your MacBook will fall farther behind the A100.\n\n2) The M2 chips from Apple are actually quite an amazing lineup and come in much larger shapes and sizes. The M2 Pro, M2 Max have 200 and 400 GB/s (you can get these in a MacBook Pro!), and the M2 Ultra (in Mac Studio) has 800 GB/s. So the M2 Ultra is the smallest, prettiest, out of the box easiest, most powerful personal LLM node today.\n\nhttps://t.co/jQfDVDl7jK",

  "text": "\"How is LLaMa.cpp possible?\" \ngreat post by @finbarrtimbers \nhttps://t.co/L0aLRXrh9f\n\nllama.cpp surprised many people (myself included) with how quickly you can run large LLMs on small computers, e.g. 7B runs @ ~16 tok/s on a MacBook. Wait don't you need supercomputers to work with LLMs?\n\nTLDR at batch_size=1 (i.e. just generating a single stream of prediction on your computer), the inference is super duper memory-bound. The on-chip compute units are twiddling their thumbs while sucking model weights through a straw from DRAM. Every individual weight that is expensively loaded from DRAM onto the chip is only used for a single instant multiply to process each new input token. So the stat to look at is not FLOPS but the memory bandwidth.\n\nLet's take a look:\nA100: 1935 GB/s memory bandwidth, 1248 TOPS\nMacBook M2: 100 GB/s, 7 TFLOPS\nThe compute is ~200X but the memory bandwidth only ~20X. So the little M2 chip that could will only be about ~20X slower than a mighty A100. This is ~10X faster than you might naively expect just looking at ops.\n\nThe situation becomes a lot more different when you inference at a very high batch size (e.g. ~160+), such as when you're hosting an LLM engine simultaneously serving a lot of parallel requests. Or in training, where you aren't forced to go serially token by token and can parallelize across both batch and time dimension, because the next token targets (labels) are known. In these cases, once you load the weights into on-chip cache and pay that large fixed cost, you can re-use them across many input examples and reach ~50%+ utilization, actually making those FLOPS count.\n\nSo TLDR why is LLM inference surprisingly fast on your MacBook? If all you want to do is batch 1 inference (i.e. a single \"stream\" of generation), only the memory bandwidth matters. And the memory bandwidth gap between chips is a lot smaller, and has been a lot harder to scale compared to flops.\n\nsupplemental figure\nhttps://t.co/2j6NGSFRPc",
