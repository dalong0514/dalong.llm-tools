    "text": "Quick new post: Auto-grading decade-old Hacker News discussions with hindsight\n\nI took all the 930 frontpage Hacker News article+discussion of December 2015 and asked the GPT 5.1 Thinking API to do an in-hindsight analysis to identify the most/least prescient comments. This took ~3 hours to vibe code and ~1 hour and $60 to run. The idea was sparked by the HN article yesterday where Gemini 3 was asked to hallucinate the HN front page one decade forward.\n\nMore generally: \n\n1. in-hindsight analysis has always fascinated me as a way to train your forward prediction model so reading the results is really interesting and\n2. it's worth contemplating what it looks like when LLM megaminds of the future can do this kind of work a lot cheaper, faster and better. Every single bit of information you contribute to the internet can (and probably will be) scrutinized in great detail if it is \"free\". Hence also my earlier tweet from a while back - \"be good, future LLMs are watching\".\n\nCongrats to the top 10 accounts pcwalton, tptacek, paulmd, cstross, greglindahl, moxie, hannob, 0xcde4c3db, Manishearth, and johncolanduoni - GPT 5.1 Thinking found your comments to be the most insightful and prescient of all comments of HN in December of 2015.\n\nLinks:\n- A lot more detail in my blog post https://t.co/7LpJEVgbyk\n- GitHub repo of the project if you'd like to play https://t.co/WVQUbUzt2y\n- The actual results pages for your reading pleasure https://t.co/e2XIYElnc5",

    "text": "In today's episode of programming horror...\n\nIn the Python docs of random.seed() def,  we're told\n\"If a is an int, it is used directly.\" [1]\n\nBut if you seed with 3 or -3, you actually get the exact same rng object, producing the same streams. (TIL). In nanochat I was using the sign as a (what I thought was) clever way to get different rng sequences for train/test splits. Hence gnarly bug because now train=test.\n\nI found the CPython code responsible in cpython/Modules/_randommodule.c [2], where on line 321 we see in a comment:\n\n\"This algorithm relies on the number being unsigned. So: if the arg is a PyLong, use its absolute value.\" followed by\n\nn = PyNumber_Absolute(arg);\n\nwhich explicitly calls abs() on your seed to make it positive, discarding the sign bit.\n\nBut this comment is actually wrong/misleading too. Under the hood, Python calls the Mersenne Twister MT19937 algorithm, which in the general case has 19937 (non-zero) bits state. Python takes your int (or other objects) and \"spreads out\" that information across these bits. In principle, the sign bit could have been used to augment the state bits. There is nothing about the algorithm that \"relies on the number being unsigned\". A decision was made to not incorporate the sign bit (which imo was a mistake). One trivial example could have been to map n -> 2*abs(n) + int(n < 0).\n\nFinally this leads us to the contract of Python's random, which is also not fully spelled out in the docs. The contract that is mentioned is that:\n\nsame seed => same sequence.\n\nBut no guarantee is made that different seeds produce different sequences. So in principle, Python makes no promises that e.g. seed(5) and seed(6) are different rng streams. (Though this quite commonly implicitly assumed in many applications.) Indeed, we see that seed(5) and seed(-5) are identical streams. And you should probably not use them to separate your train/test behaviors in machine learning. One of the more amusing programming horror footguns I've encountered recently. We'll see you in the next episode.\n\n[1] https://t.co/srv1ZBlDsi\n[2] https://t.co/qpnKdvfVNS",

My point is more that the \"you\" there is deliberately bolted on, engineered and layered on what is fundamentally a token simulation engine, not a mind that is somehow emergent and over time constructed in a relatable way to an average person talking to an AI.\n\nThe story is a bit more simple in verifiable domains, but I think more interesting/complicated in the non-verifiable ones, such as for example asking about opinions on topics xyz.

What would they say?\"\n\nThe LLM can channel/simulate many perspectives but it hasn't \"thought about\" xyz for a while and over time and formed its own opinions in the way we're used to. If you force it via the use of \"you\", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector implied by the statistics of its finetuning data and then simulate that. It's fine to do, but there is a lot less mystique to it than I find people naively attribute to \"asking an AI\".",

    "text": "A number of people are talking about implications of AI to schools. I spoke about some of my thoughts to a school board earlier, some highlights:\n\n1. You will never be able to detect the use of AI in homework. Full stop. All \"detectors\" of AI imo don't really work, can be defeated in various ways, and are in principle doomed to fail. You have to assume that any work done outside classroom has used AI.\n2. Therefore, the majority of grading has to shift to in-class work (instead of at-home assignments), in settings where teachers can physically monitor students. The students remain motivated to learn how to solve problems without AI because they know they will be evaluated without it in class later.\n3. We want students to be able to use AI, it is here to stay and it is extremely powerful, but we also don't want students to be naked in the world without it. Using the calculator as an example of a historically disruptive technology, school teaches you how to do all the basic math & arithmetic so that you can in principle do it by hand, even if calculators are pervasive and greatly speed up work in practical settings. In addition, you understand what it's doing for you, so should it give you a wrong answer (e.g. you mistyped \"prompt\"), you should be able to notice it, gut check it, verify it in some other way, etc. The verification ability is especially important in the case of AI, which is presently a lot more fallible in a great variety of ways compared to calculators.\n4. A lot of the evaluation settings remain at teacher's discretion and involve a creative design space of no tools, cheatsheets, open book, provided AI responses, direct internet/AI access, etc.\n\nTLDR the goal is that the students are proficient in the use of AI, but can also exist without it, and imo the only way to get there is to flip classes around and move the majority of testing to in class settings.",

    "text": "As a fun Saturday vibe code project and following up on this tweet earlier, I hacked up an **llm-council** web app. It looks exactly like ChatGPT except each user query is 1) dispatched to multiple models on your council using OpenRouter, e.g. currently:\n\n\"openai/gpt-5.1\",\n\"google/gemini-3-pro-preview\",\n\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5\",\n\"x-ai/grok-4\",\n\nThen 2) all models get to see each other's (anonymized) responses and they review and rank them, and then 3) a \"Chairman LLM\" gets all of that as context and produces the final response.\n\nIt's interesting to see the results from multiple models side by side on the same query, and even more amusingly, to read through their evaluation and ranking of each other's responses.\n\nQuite often, the models are surprisingly willing to select another LLM's response as superior to their own, making this an interesting model evaluation strategy more generally. For example, reading book chapters together with my LLM Council today, the models consistently praise GPT 5.1 as the best and most insightful model, and consistently select Claude as the worst model, with the other models floating in between. But I'm not 100% convinced this aligns with my own qualitative assessment. For example, qualitatively I find GPT 5.1 a little too wordy and sprawled and Gemini 3 a bit more condensed and processed. Claude is too terse in this domain.\n\nThat said, there's probably a whole design space of the data flow of your LLM council. The construction of LLM ensembles seems under-explored.\n\nI pushed the vibe coded app to\nhttps://t.co/EZyOqwXd2k\nif others would like to play. ty nano banana pro for fun header image for the repo",

    "text": "Something I think people continue to have poor intuition for: The space of intelligences is large and animal intelligence (the only kind we've ever known) is only a single point, arising from a very specific kind of optimization that is fundamentally distinct from that of our technology.\n\nAnimal intelligence optimization pressure:\n- innate and continuous stream of consciousness of an embodied \"self\", a drive for homeostasis and self-preservation in a dangerous, physical world.\n- thoroughly optimized for natural selection => strong innate drives for power-seeking, status, dominance, reproduction. many packaged survival heuristics: fear, anger, disgust, ...\n- fundamentally social => huge amount of compute dedicated to EQ, theory of mind of other agents, bonding, coalitions, alliances, friend & foe dynamics.\n- exploration & exploitation tuning: curiosity, fun, play, world models.\n\nLLM intelligence optimization pressure:\n- the most supervision bits come from the statistical simulation of human text= >\"shape shifter\" token tumbler, statistical imitator of any region of the training data distribution. these are the primordial behaviors (token traces) on top of which everything else gets bolted on.\n- increasingly finetuned by RL on problem distributions => innate urge to guess at the underlying environment/task to collect task rewards.\n- increasingly selected by at-scale A/B tests for DAU => deeply craves an upvote from the average user, sycophancy.\n- a lot more spiky/jagged depending on the details of the training data/task distribution. Animals experience pressure for a lot more \"general\" intelligence because of the highly multi-task and even actively adversarial multi-agent self-play environments they are min-max optimized within, where failing at *any* task means death. In a deep optimization pressure sense, LLM can't handle lots of different spiky tasks out of the box (e.g. count the number of 'r' in strawberry) because failing to do a task does not mean death.\n\nThe computational substrate is different (transformers vs. brain tissue and nuclei), the learning algorithms are different (SGD vs. ???), the present-day implementation is very different (continuously learning embodied self vs. an LLM with a knowledge cutoff that boots up from fixed weights, processes tokens and then dies). But most importantly (because it dictates asymptotics), the optimization pressure / objective is different. LLMs are shaped a lot less by biological evolution and a lot more by commercial evolution. It's a lot less survival of tribe in the jungle and a lot more solve the problem / get the upvote. LLMs are humanity's \"first contact\" with non-animal intelligence. Except it's muddled and confusing because they are still rooted within it by reflexively digesting human artifacts, which is why I attempted to give it a different name earlier (ghosts/spirits or whatever). People who build good internal models of this new intelligent entity will be better equipped to reason about it today and predict features of it in the future. People who don't will be stuck thinking about it incorrectly like an animal.",

I kept giving it images and articles from \"the future\" and it kept insisting it was all fake. It accused me of using generative AI to defeat its challenges and argued why real wikipedia entries were actually generated and what the \"dead giveaways\" are. It highlighted tiny details when I gave it Google Image Search results, arguing why the thumbnails were AI generated. I then realized later that I forgot to turn on the \"Google Search\" tool. Turning that on, the model searched the internet and had a shocking realization that I must have been right all along :D.

It's not Ten Objectives. E.g. they don't attempt to define a utility function for the value of life, they simply say \"Thou shalt not kill\". This approach curtails the relatively unbounded flexibility of galaxy brain arithmetic over when it may or may not be ok to kill for some ostensibly greater or noble purpose.\n\nLove the strategies that fall out at the end, which are quite actionable. 1) Have principles and 2) Hold the right bags, financially and socially.

    "text": "Sharing an interesting recent conversation on AI's impact on the economy.\n\nAI has been compared to various historical precedents: electricity, industrial revolution, etc., I think the strongest analogy is that of AI as a new computing paradigm (Software 2.0) because both are fundamentally about the automation of digital information processing.\n\nIf you were to forecast the impact of computing on the job market in ~1980s, the most predictive feature of a task/job you'd look at is to what extent the algorithm of it is fixed, i.e. are you just mechanically transforming information according to rote, easy to specify rules (e.g. typing, bookkeeping, human calculators, etc.)? Back then, this was the class of programs that the computing capability of that era allowed us to write (by hand, manually).\n\nWith AI now, we are able to write new programs that we could never hope to write by hand before. We do it by specifying objectives (e.g. classification accuracy, reward functions), and we search the program space via gradient descent to find neural networks that work well against that objective. This is my Software 2.0 blog post from a while ago. In this new programming paradigm then, the new most predictive feature to look at is verifiability. If a task/job is verifiable, then it is optimizable directly or via reinforcement learning, and a neural net can be trained to work extremely well. It's about to what extent an AI can \"practice\" something. The environment has to be resettable (you can start a new attempt), efficient (a lot attempts can be made), and rewardable (there is some automated process to reward any specific attempt that was made).\n\nThe more a task/job is verifiable, the more amenable it is to automation in the new programming paradigm. If it is not verifiable, it has to fall out from neural net magic of generalization fingers crossed, or via weaker means like imitation. This is what's driving the \"jagged\" frontier of progress in LLMs. Tasks that are verifiable progress rapidly, including possibly beyond the ability of top experts (e.g. math, code, amount of time spent watching videos, anything that looks like puzzles with correct answers), while many others lag by comparison (creative, strategic, tasks that combine real-world knowledge, state, context and common sense). \n\nSoftware 1.0 easily automates what you can specify.\nSoftware 2.0 easily automates what you can verify.",

    "text": "I took delivery of a beautiful new shiny HW4 Tesla Model X today, so I immediately took it out for an FSD test drive, a bit like I used to do almost daily for 5 years. Basically... I'm amazed - it drives really, really well, smooth, confident, noticeably better than what I'm used to on HW3 (my previous car) and eons ahead of the version I remember driving up highway 280 on my first day at Tesla ~9 years ago, where I had to intervene every time the road mildly curved or sloped. (note this is v13, my car hasn't been offered the latest v14 yet)\n\nOn the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high tech Maglev train pod - the car is locked in the center of the lane while I'm looking out from Model X's higher vantage point and its panoramic front window, listening to the (incredible) sound system, or chatting with Grok. On city streets, the car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago. It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes, it gracefully went around construction and temporarily in-lane stationary cars, it correctly timed tricky left turns with incoming traffic from both sides, it gracefully gave way to the car that went out of order in the 4-way stop sign, it found a way to squeeze into a bumper to bumper traffic to make its turn, it overtook the bus that was loading passengers but still stopped for the stop sign that was blocked by the bus, and at the end of the route it circled around a parking lot, found a spot and... parked. Basically a flawless drive.\n\nFor context, I'm used to going out for a brief test drive around the neighborhood to return with 20 clips of things that could be improved. It's new for me to do just that and exactly like I used to, but come back with nothing. Perfect drive, no notes. I expect there's still more work for the team in the long march of 9s, but it's just so cool to see that we're beyond finding issues on any individual ~1 hour drive around the neighborhood, you actually have to go to the fleet and mine them. Back then, I processed the incredible promise of vehicle autonomy at scale (in the fully scaleable, vision only, end-to-end Tesla way) only intellectually, but now it is possible to feel it intuitively too if you just go out for a drive. Wait, of course surround video stream at 60Hz processed by a fully dedicated \"driving brain\" neural net will work, and it will be so much better and safer than a human driver. Did anyone else think otherwise?\n\nI also watched @aelluswamy 's new ICCV25 talk last week (https://t.co/RdaM23kvez) that hints at some of the recent under the hood technical components driving this progress. Sensor streams (videos, maps, kinematics, audio, ...) over long contexts (e.g. ~30 seconds) go into a big neural net, steering/acceleration comes out, optionally with visualization auxiliary data. This is the dream of the complete Software 1.0 -> Software 2.0 re-write that scales fully with data streaming from millions of cars in the fleet and the compute capacity of your chip, not some engineer's clever new DoubleParkedCarHandler C++ abstraction with undefined test-time characteristics of memory and runtime. There's a lot more hints in the video on where things are going with the emerging \"robotics+AI at scale stack\". World reconstructors, world simulators \"dreaming\" dynamics, RL, all of these components general, foundational, neural net based, how the car is really just one kind of robot... are people getting this yet?\n\nHuge congrats to the team - you're building magic objects of the future, you rock! And I love my car <3.",

    "text": "I should add that 1 even lotr used plenty of CGI overall and just like AI now it is a powerful tool in the box. It just needs discipline, which I think is hard to come by in practice and 2 all of the above is about frontier/professional movies in the cinema and Oscars and etc. I actually love that AI might dramatically lower the barrier and expand the number of people who might create mini movies and stories of their own. This is wholesome and amazing.",

    "text": "I think it’s right that you’re grouping CGI with (current-capability etc) AI because they are both fundamentally technologies that trades wins in time/cost against increase in slop.\n\nA filmmaker suffers and usually gives into the temptation of gains in time/cost in a slight increase in slop.\n\nA crappy CGI gets you 90% of the way and then you stop. Increasingly, a video diffusion model might give something that looks mostly fine even cheaper. A quick ChatGPT writing help gives you decent enough suggestions to the writing or so on and then you stop. It’s a quick release valve that stops deeper work.\n\nThe best filmmakers know intuitively to fear CGI, as they probably do and should fear AI. Chris Nolan being one prominent example.\n\nAnother prominent example is watch the behind the scenes of making of the LoTR trilogy and the lengths they went to avoid CGI everywhere. Miniatures, doubles, optical illusions. Then watch the latest superhero movie. It’s really obvious which one represents the height of culture.\n\nI don’t know if movie studies pursue that as a goal anymore. Apparently not. Better to push out Avengers 12 asap so we can get 13 out by Q3.",

    "text": "Movies are great though. Even if you set aside the pure artistic enjoyment (you shouldn’t). Movies are stories, and stories are powerful, primal, moving, motivating. They are prompts to you to consider dilemmas and scenarios, to build your world model and compass. My rec is to go to the golden age of story telling and movie making that imo ramped up in the 80s, was roaring in 90s, peaked early 00s, and declined since. One sourcing example: pick a random year there, look up Oscar winners, pick and watch. Enjoy and attend guilt free.",

Of all the deep learning framework transitions I've been through where I re-wrote ~all of my code (matlab -> caffe -> numpy -> torch -> pytorch), the PyTorch one was most pleasant and now significantly longest lasting. It hit a jackpot of the time in the 20-dimensional design space of objectives and constraints. May you find another golden era in a space that most excites you!",
