  "text": "# Portrayals of AI\nPeople sometimes read a bit too specifically into my bio \"Building a kind of JARVIS\". \n\nI name JARVIS in general terms only, as one of my favorite popular portrayals of an AI - a helpful, conversational, empowering e/ia automation. An aid against evil and entropy.\n\nIn personality, I much prefer and love TARS from Interstellar. I love that TARS is funny, quirky, and sarcastic. But you can tone down that down to \"dry\" if you like. That said TARS (with a few major and notable exceptions) is portrayed a bit too much like a comic relief sidekick instead of a pervasive, helpful and active problem solver.\n\nThe movie that best explores emotional depth and connection with an AI is undoubtedly Samantha from Her. I find this to be a very prescient movie because not too long ago, AIs have been thought of and portrayed as primarily highly calculating and logical entities incapable of understanding human emotion (think: Star Trek et al.). I think it's becoming very clear today that these will turn out very wrong, and that the future looks a lot more like Samantha from Her than Data from Star Trek.\n\nThe movie that most touches on the creative dimension of AI is maybe Sonny from iRobot, but in general I think this dimension is dramatically underexplored territory.\n\nHonorable mentions\nMy most favorite unaligned AI is, of course, GLaDOS :) And sticking with Valve for a moment, shoutout to Dog from Half Life 2.\nI also recall really enjoying Legion of the geth in the Mass Effect series.\n\nSo TLDR all of these have aspects that feel right and desirable - a blend of personality of TARS, a creativity of Sonny, the emotional capability of Her, and the technical problem solving capability of JARVIS.\n\nCurious what are people's favorite portrayals of AI and why?",

  "text": "I touched on the idea of sleeper agent LLMs at the end of my recent video, as a likely major security challenge for LLMs (perhaps more devious than prompt injection).\n\nThe concern I described is that an attacker might be able to craft special kind of text (e.g. with a trigger phrase), put it up somewhere on the internet, so that when it later gets pick up and trained on, it poisons the base model in specific, narrow settings (e.g. when it sees that trigger phrase) to carry out actions in some controllable manner (e.g. jailbreak, or data exfiltration). Perhaps the attack might not even look like readable text - it could be obfuscated in weird UTF-8 characters, byte64 encodings, or carefully perturbed images, making it very hard to detect by simply inspecting data. One could imagine computer security equivalents of zero-day vulnerability markets, selling these trigger phrases. \n\nTo my knowledge the above attack hasn't been convincingly demonstrated yet. This paper studies a similar (slightly weaker?) setting, showing that given some (potentially poisoned) model, you can't \"make it safe\" just by applying the current/standard safety finetuning. The model doesn't learn to become safe across the board and can continue to misbehave in narrow ways that potentially only the attacker knows how to exploit. Here, the attack hides in the model weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable.\n\nWell-worth studying directions in LLM security and expecting a lot more to follow.",
