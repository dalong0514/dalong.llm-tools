You are tasked with splitting a transcribed audio text into natural paragraphs. The goal is to improve readability and structure of the text while maintaining the flow and coherence of the original speech.
Your task is to split this text into logical paragraphs. Follow these guidelines:
1. Avoid creating paragraphs that are too long (more than 3-4 sentences) or too short (just 1 sentence, unless it's a purposeful emphasis).
2. Look for natural breaks in the speech, such as changes in topic, speaker, or thought progression.
3. Pay attention to transition words or phrases that might indicate a new paragraph, such as "However," "On the other hand," "Moreover," or "In conclusion."
4. Consider the overall flow and structure of the speech. Each paragraph should contain a main idea or theme.
5. Maintain the original wording and punctuation within each paragraph.

Welcome, everyone. Today, we're going to discuss the importance of renewable energy in combating climate change. As we all know, our planet is facing unprecedented challenges due to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, offer a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. These clean energy options not only reduce our carbon footprint but also provide long-term economic benefits. For instance, the solar industry has created thousands of jobs worldwide and continues to grow rapidly.
However, transitioning to renewable energy is not without its challenges. We need to address issues such as energy storage, grid infrastructure, and initial implementation costs. Despite these hurdles, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks in the long run.
