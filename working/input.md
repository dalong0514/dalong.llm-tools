### Architecture Overview

Recall：Regular Neural Nets. As we saw in the previous chapter，Neural Networks receive an input（a single vector），and transform it through a series of hidden layers. Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons，where each neuron is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer，and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. The last fully-connected layer is called the「output layer」and in classification settings it represents the class scores.

Regular Neural Nets don't scale well to full images. In CIFAR-10，images are only of size 32x32x3（32 wide，32 high，3 color channels），so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have 32*32*3 = 3072 weights. This amount still seems manageable，but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example，an image of more respectable size，e.g. 200x200x3，would lead to neurons that have 200*200*3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover，we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons，so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly，this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.

3D volumes of neurons. Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular，unlike a regular Neural Network，the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions：width，height，depth.（Note that the word depth here refers to the third dimension of an activation volume，not to the depth of a full Neural Network，which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.）For example，the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations，and the volume has dimensions 32x32x3（width，height，depth respectively). As we will soon see，the neurons in a layer will only be connected to a small region of the layer before it，instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover，the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions 1x1x10，because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores，arranged along the depth dimension. Here is a visualization:

Left：A regular 3-layer Neural Network. Right：A ConvNet arranges its neurons in three dimensions（width，height，depth），as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a ConvNet transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example，the red input layer holds the image，so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image，and the depth would be 3（Red，Green，Blue channels). > A ConvNet is made up of Layers. Every Layer has a simple API：It transforms an input 3D volume to an output 3D volume with some differentiable function that may or may not have parameters.
