Notice that we included autonomy in our definition. We need to be careful about this. As we will see in Chapter 4, the concept of autonomy is a difficult one. It means different things to different people, ranging from the fairly innocent, such as being able to operate without too much help or assistance from others, to the more controversial, which sees cognition as one of the central processes by which advanced biological systems preserve their autonomy. From this perspective, cognitive development has two primary functions: (1) to increase the system’s repertoire of effective actions, and (2) to extend the time-horizon of its ability to anticipate the need for and outcome of future actions.13  

Without wishing to preempt the discussion in Chapter 4, because there is a tight relationship between cognition and autonomy — or not, depending on who you ask — we will pause here just a while to consider autonomy a little more.  

From a biological perspective, autonomy is an organizational characteristic of living creatures that enables them to use their own capacities to manage their interactions with the world in order to remain viable, i.e., to stay alive. To a very large extent, autonomy is concerned with the system maintaining itself: selfmaintenance, for short.14 This means that the system is entirely self-governing and self-regulating. It is not controlled by any outside agency and this allows it to stand apart from the rest of the environment and assert an identity of its own. That’s not to say that the system isn’t influenced by the world around it, but rather that these influences are brought about through interactions that must not threaten the autonomous operation of the system.15
