## Preface

In 2002, cognitive scientist Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University won I the Nobel Prize in Economics for work done with his longtime collaborator Amos Tversky (who died in 1996). The press release for the award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences drew attention to the roots of the awardwinning work in “the analysis of human judgment and decision-making by cognitive psychologists." Kahneman was cited for discovering “"how human judgment may take heuristic shortcuts that systematically depart from basic principles of probability. His work has inspired a new generation of researchers in economics and finance to enrich economic theory using insights from cognitive psychology into intrinsic human motivation."  

In short, Kahneman and Tversky's work was about how humans make choices and assess probabilities, and they uncovered some very basic errors that are typical in decision making. Their work includes some of the most influential and highly cited studies in all of psychology, and it deserved to be honored with the Nobel Prize. One reason that this work was so influential was that it addressed deep issues concerning human rationality. As the Nobel announcement noted, “Kahneman and Tversky discovered how judgment under uncertainty systematically departs from the kind of rationality postulated in traditional economic theory" The thinking errors uncovered by Kahneman and Tversky are thus not trivial errors in a parlor game. Being rational means acting to achieve one's own life goals using the best means possible. To violate the thinking rules examined by Kahneman and Tversky thus has the practical consequence that we are less satisfied with our lives than we might be.  

The work of Kahneman and Tversky, along with that of many other investigators, has shown how the basic architecture of human cognition makes all of us prone to these errors of judgment and decision making. But being prone to these errors does not mean that we always make them. Every person, on some occasions, overrides the tendency to make these reasoning errors and instead makes the rational response. It is not that we always make errors all the time. Even more important, it has been shown that there are systematic diferences among individuals in the tendency to make errors of judgment and decision making. My own research group has tried to find out what predicts these individual differences. 

The fact that there are systematic individual differences in the judgment and decision-making situations studied by Kahneman and Tversky means that there are variations in important attributes of human cognition related to rationality —- how efficient we are in achieving our goals. It is a curious fact that none of these critical attributes of human thinking are assessed on IQ tests (or their proxies such as the SAT test). This fact is curious for two related reasons. First, most laypeople are prone to think that IQ tests are tests of, to put it colloquially, good thinking. Scientists and laypeople alike would tend to agree that “good thinking" encompasses good judgment and decision making—the type of thinking that helps us achieve our goals. In fact, the type of “good thinking" that Kahneman and Tversky studied was deemed so important that research on it was awarded the Nobel Prize. Yet assessments of such good thinking are nowhere to be found on IQ tests.  

A second, and related, point is that when people use the term intelligence (again, laypersons and psychologists alike), they often talk as if the concept of intelligence encompassed rationality. For example, many conceptions of intelligence define it as involving adaptive decision making. Adaptive decision making is the quintessence of rationality, but the items used to assess intelligence on widely accepted tests bear no resemblance to measures of rational decision making. This creates some curious phenomena that we do in fact tend to notice. We do tend to notice, and to find mildly perplexing, "smart people doing dumb things." But the way that we have historically measured intelligence makes this phenomenon not perplexing at all. If by smart we mean IQ-test smart and by dumb we mean poor decision making, then the source of the phenomenon is clear. IQ tests do not measure adaptive decision making. So if we are surprised at a high-IQ person acting foolishly, it can only mean that we think that all good mental attributes must co-occur with high intelligence -— in this case, that rational thinking must go with high intelligence. However, research is increasingly bringing this assumption into question. Rational thinking skills of the type studied by Kahneman and Tversky show only small-to-medium correlations with intelligence test performance— not surprisingly, because tests of the latter make no direct assessment of the former.  

In the present book, I explore the issue of whether they should. Judgment and decision-making skills — the skills of rational thought - are at least as important as the attributes that are assessed on IQ tests. Like intelligence, rational thinking skills relate to goal achievement in the real world. Yet we fail to teach them in schools or to focus our attention on them as a society. Instead, we keep using intelligence proxies as selection devices in educational institutions from exclusive preschools to graduate schools. Corporations and the military are likewise excessively focused on IQ measures. The lavish attention devoted to intelligence (raising it, praising it, worrying when it is low, etc.) seems wasteful when we virtually ignore another set of mental skills with just as much social consequence.  

The thinking skills studied by Kahneman and Tversky cash out in terms of real-world behaviors that affect people's happiness and well-being. They are just as important as the cognitive skills assessed on IQ tests. Intelligence tests are thus radically incomplete as measures of cognitive functioning. Because of their vast influence, IQ tests have both explicitly and implicitly defined, for the layperson and psychologist alike, what cognitive attributes to value. These are important abilities, to be sure, but the tests leave out huge domains of cognitive functioning. We do not need to stretch to noncognitive domainsto notions such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence -- to see important lacunae in the tests. That would be implicitly conceding too much. It would seem to concede that the tests cover the cognitive domain quite well and that we need to go outside the cognitive domain, or at least straddle it (into things like emotion, creativity, aesthetic sensibility, interpersonal skills) in order to find things that IQ tests miss. I believe we need not look so far afield. The skills of judgment and decision making are cognitive skills that are the foundation of rational thought and action, and they are missing from IQ tests.  

This book, then, is an extended meditation on the scientific and social consequences of a historical irony of the behavioral sciences: The Nobel Prize was awarded for studies of cognitive characteristics that are entirely missing from the most well-known mental assessment device in the behavioral sciences -- the intelligence test.  

## Acknowledgements

My intellectual debts in writing this book are immense and are repreVI sented in the wide literature that I cite. Nonetheless I would single out several foundational influences. Decades ago, the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky inspired my interest in rational thinking tasks that were new to psychology at the time. More recently, the work of Jonathan Evans and David Over provoked me to make my own contributions to dualprocess theory. I have long admired Jonathan Baron's use of the heuristics and biases literature to illuminate public policy issues. I thank David Perkins for coining the term mindware, which I have used liberally in this book. From the standpoint of my interest in individual differences in cognitive functioning, the work of Robert Sternberg has been infuential. The key points in several chapters of this book were inspired by his theoretical and empirical contributions. I say this in full awareness that he will dislike several of my arguments. Nevertheless, I thank him for his relentless probing of the intelligence construct and his willingness to mix it up with me over the dysrationalia concept a decade ago.  

My literary agent, Susan Arellano, is thanked for her patience in helping me work out what would be the central themes of this book. She aided me greatly in seeing what should be central and what should be peripheral. My editor at Yale University Press, Keith Condon, is thanked for his enthusiasm for the project and for making important structural suggestions for the book. Susan Laity was very helpful with manuscript editing, and Katherine Scheuer did wonderful work with the copyediting.  

This book was crafted in many places with great views: in my ninth-floor office overlooking downtown Toronto and Lake Ontario; in St. Ives, Cornwall, overlooking the Atlantic; and on the Oregon coast overlooking the Pacific. Two people have been with me in all of these settings. Richard West, my colleague of thirty years, has been a continuous sounding board for these ideas. Many nights on my balcony in Toronto and down in the clearing have done wonders for my morale. Paula Stanovich has been the shining light behind all of the work that I do. She has helped me build the life that made this workpossible.  

David Over of the University of Durham, Maggie Toplak of York University, and an anonymous reviewer read the entire manuscript and provided many discerning comments. Three conferences were seminal in allowing me to discuss these ideas at length: the Fourth International Thinking Conference in Durham, England; the Conference on Dual-Process Theories of Reasoning and Rationality in Cambridge, England, organized by Jonathan Evans and Keith Frankish; and a workshop on dual-process theory at the University of Virginia organized by Tim Wilson and Jonathan Evans.  

The Chairs of my Department while this book was being written, Janet Astington and Esther Geva, and my Deans, Michael Fullan and Jane Gaskell, provided great administrative support for this work. Mary Macri, our Department's business officer, took care of my technical and logistical needs with extraordinary dedication, as did my secretaries Diana Robinson and Marisa Freire. My empirical research on some of the issues discussed in this volume was made possible by support received from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and by the Canada Research Chairs program. Marilyn Kertoy and Anne Cunningham are always part of my personal and intellectual support team.  

Most members of the Stanovich/West lab (a joint lab linking the University of Toronto and James Madison University) in the past decade have contributed in some way to the research of our own that is cited in this volume. Leaders in the lab now well into their post-Ph.D. careers are represented by Caroline Ho, Robyn Macpherson, Walter Sa, and Maggie Toplak. Other lab members thanked for their participation are Maria Grunewald, Carol Kelley, Judi Kokis, Eleanor Liu, Russ Meserve, Laura Page, George Potworowski, Jason Riis, Rachel Ryerson, Robin Sidhu, Ron Stringer, Rebecca WellsJopling, and Joan Wolforth.
