INTRODUCTION

THE SITUATION NOW

As the stakes are raised in testing and accountability，recall of subject matter has become more and more important. However，both past and present voices are raising questions about using recall as the sole bottom line of schooling. Although recall is important，recall is not to be confused with depth knowledge，thought，and learning. As Paul said,「To this day we have refused to face these facts about knowledge，thought，and learning. To this day we commonly teach as if mere recall were equivalent to knowledge」(1993，p. viii).

There is no question that recall is crucial in this day of high-stakes testing. Furthermore，brain research is teaching educators about many ways to assist students in recalling information. However，recall alone is not enough for the person of the twenty-first century. Indeed，some standardized testing does reflect the demand for skills that go far beyond recall:

Recall alone is not enough for the person of the twenty-first century.

Yet classroom instruction around the world，at all levels，is typically didactic，one-dimensional，and indifferent，when not antithetical，to reason. Blank faces are taught barren conclusions in dreary drills. There is nothing sharp，nothing poignant，no exciting twist or turn of mind and thought，nothing fearless，nothing modest，no struggle，no conflict，no rational give-and-take，no intellectual excitement or discipline，no pulsation in the heart or mind. Students are not expected to ask for reasons to justify what they are told to believe. They do not question what they see，hear，or read，nor are they encouraged to do so. . . . They do not challenge the thinking of other students nor expect their thinking to be challenged by others.（Paul，1993，p. ix)

Teachers cheat their students if all they ask of them is recall. By asking only for recall，teachers convey the message that the students' own thinking is not valuable and that questioning and challenging ideas is not welcome—this makes for very boring class situations and creates minds that are dull and lazy. Talk about「dumbing down」the curriculum.

THE CASE FOR HIGHER-ORDER THINKING

As educators look ahead to future schools，much of the data and information they rely on today may be changed or repudiated.「To prepare our young people for the possibilities and probabilities of the future that few of us can imagine，the wisest course seems to be a curriculum that triggers their critical and creative thinking」(Bellanca & Fogarty，1986，p. 5).

What can remain forever useful to the students of today is the capacity to think clearly and creatively in life and work situations. Prentice makes it clear:「Teaching thinking is an essential foundation for developing the minds of tomorrow's adults」(Prentice，1994，p. xi). In addition to requiring crucial data，information，concepts，processes，and tools，teachers are being called on to enable the thinking of every student. To prepare students for the world of rapid change，it is absolutely imperative that teachers groom their students to think critically and to think on their own. Consequently，the role of higher-order thinking，which has been encouraged by educators since the 1980s，has become more important than ever. Caine and Caine point this out:

Perhaps the most significant thing we have confirmed for ourselves is that，although actions are important，the thinking that influences and shapes what we do is far more critical. Changing our thinking is the first thing we have to do both individually and collectively，because without that change we cannot possibly change what we really do on a day-to-day basis.（1997，p. vi)

It is absolutely imperative that teachers groom their students to think critically and to think on their own.

The ability to think critically that comes with having the tools for higher-order thinking can help students far into their future not only grasp new information and material but also figure out how to change and adapt to new situations. Meir says,「Feuerstein argues that enhancing a child's cognitive abilities can have a snowballing effect in that，with these abilities enhanced，the child is capable of learning additional and even more complex cognitive operations and strategies」(Meir，1994，p. 90). Feuerstein offers the possibility of ever-increasing higher order thinking capacities as more and more higher-order thinking occurs. Earlier，Paul suggested that higher-order thinking has a direct connection to the quality of life.

Elder and Paul strongly articulate that「thinking is at the heart of our future，not only for our society but for every society in the world」(1994，p. 34). They suggest three massive trends are gaining predominance：accelerating change，intensifying complexity，and increasing interdependence（p. 34). In their perspective，this makes it crystal clear that only minds that are adept at higher-order thinking skills can deal with the change，the complexity，and the interdependence that now are inextricably part of the world.

THE HIGHER-ORDER THINKING CLASSROOM OF THE FUTURE

What clues do educators have as to the nature of the higher-order thinking classroom of the future? Sylwester（1995）envisions a classroom where teachers draw abilities out of a student as well as offer information to the student. He sees teachers helping students create their own framework of categories rather than being handed a framework from the teacher（p. 23).「It isn't enough for students to be in a stimulating environment—they have to help create it and directly interact with it. They have to have many opportunities to tell their stories，not just to listen to the teacher's stories」(p. 131).

Teachers have known for years that students rise to the expectations their teachers have of them. That is why Sylwester（1995）proposes that teachers not only provide students with a dynamic environment but also allow students to fashion that environment and be active within it. For students，he says,「Such activities as student projects，cooperative learning，and portfolio assessments place students at the center of the educative process，and thus stimulate learning」(p. 132). He also says,「Thus，teachers and parents become facilitators，who help to shape a stimulating social environment that helps students to work alone and together to solve the problems they confront」(p. 139).

All of this can promote an environment of higher-order thinking given the skills of the teacher to ask higher-order questions and pose appropriately complex problems to solve. As Sylwester says,

Edelman's model of our brain as a rich，layered，messy，unplanned jungle ecosystem is especially intriguing，however，because it suggests that a junglelike brain might thrive best in a junglelike classroom that includes many sensory，cultural，and problem layers that are closely related to the real-world environment in which we live—the environment that best stimulates the neural networks that are genetically tuned to it.（Sylwester，1995，p. 23)

Although the average teacher might be appalled at the notion of「a junglelike classroom,」many insightful teachers yearn for a rich，complex classroom that challenges the senses，emotions，and thinking of all the students. It is this very「junglelike classroom」that can allow buried gifts and strengths in the student to come to the fore. It is such a「junglelike classroom」that could call forth higher order thinking from every student.

Many insightful teachers yearn for a rich，complex classroom that challenges the senses，emotions，and thinking of all the students.

The higher-order thinking classroom of the future「is a classroom in which the teacher purposefully gives priority to teaching students multiple ways to think about what they are learning」(Bellanca & Fogarty，1986，p. 4). This may seem obvious to teachers，yet so many teachers are constrained by demands to produce higher test scores or to inculcate the state or district standards that delving into the teaching of thinking seems impossible in an already crowded lesson. This is in spite of the fact that essentially educators have known how to do this for some time:「We have made giant strides in identifying ways to improve instruction so that all students can learn faster and better. Included in these improvements are the methodologies to help all students become more skillful thinkers」(Bellanca & Fogarty，1986，p. 3).

Another crucial concern is helping all teachers believe that all students can think. Again，this is a critical expectation for teachers to bring to the classroom. When a teacher has decided that only one-third of a particular class can think，then his or her instruction is vastly different than when he or she presumes that，on some level，all students are able to think:

If and when teachers believe that all students can think . . . and all students need to think，that message is communicated to the students. Teachers who value thinking challenge all students to stretch. These teachers cause students to interpret，analyze，translate，hypothesize，predict，apply，synthesize，and evaluate what they learn. They expect students to discuss，debate，answer high level questions，prove，write，think aloud and critically and creatively attach the ideas shared by the teacher，the texts and peers.（Bellanca & Fogarty，1986，p. 6)

Needless to say，higher-order thinking as described by Bellanca and Fogarty does not happen overnight. It takes time and effort，and thus，may seem overwhelming to teachers with already crowded schedules. But，effort in the area of higher-order thinking certainly pays off in the long run—even on the unavoidable standardized tests. The most difficult step may be changing one's belief from only some children are able to think in a higher level to all children are able to think in a higher level.「Starting with the belief that all children can learn to think more critically and creatively，the effective teacher need do little more than add to her repertoire of skills and methodologies that promote skillful thinking」(Bellanca & Fogarty，1986，p. 6).

Effort in the area of higher-order thinking certainly pays off in the long run.

The Five Rs

Higher-order thinking categories were suggested first by William E. Doll，Jr. in an1993 article called「Curriculum Possibilities in a ‘Post'-Future.」He used four categories to illuminate future curriculum：Richness，Recursion，Relations，and Rigor. Fogarty（1997）built on Doll's categories and articulated a modified five categories：Relevance，Richness，Relatedness，Rigor，and Recursiveness（see Figure Intro. 1). These five categories，called the Five Rs，clarify why higher-order thinking skills are urgently needed for every student.

Figure Intro.1. Five mega thinking skills.

THE LIFE QUESTIONS

Most educators understand that higher-order thinking，although abstract，is necessary for students in classrooms. However，it is equally important to understand that higher-order thinking is necessary for students outside classrooms as well. Higher-order thinking skills are not just important for getting through school（which goal for some students generates a「So what?」attitude）but also are critical for getting through life. With thoughtful work by teachers to relate higher-order thinking skills to everyday life needs and to each human's life questions，the relevancy of higher-order thinking skills to life does not go unnoticed. Unless this connection is made and perhaps even overemphasized，students may not understand the need for such skills.

Higher-order thinking skills are not just important for getting through school but also are critical for getting through life.

Consequently，as part of the discussion of each of the five Rs，some of the appropriate life questions are identified and discussed. Of course，there may be different ones for different students at different times and in different situations.

THREE LEVELS

Late in the 1980s，Fogarty and Bellanca articulated three levels of thinking in a construct they called the「Three Story Intellect」(Fogarty & Bellanca，1991，p. 89). They called these three levels gathering，processing，and applying. In the first-story gathering level，teachers enable students to get acquainted with data，information，and concepts. Teachers check this level of understanding by asking questions using verbs such as describe，recite，tell，name，and so on. In the second-story processing level，teachers encourage students to work with the data，information，and concepts to move toward deep understanding of the material. It is in this level that the meaning and significance of the material becomes clear. Teachers check this level of understanding by asking questions using verbs such as compare and contrast，explain why，analyze，categorize，infer，and so forth. In the third-story applying level，teachers emphasize the usefulness and applicability of the material to everyday life. Teachers check this level of understanding by asking questions using verbs such as imagine，predict，create，evaluate，speculate，and so on.

Patterned after the construct of the three levels of thinking，higher-order thinking skills also have been arranged in three levels：understanding information，generating insight，and discerning implications. Let's look at each more closely.

Understanding Information

The first level in higher-order thinking skills，understanding information，starts one level up from Fogarty and Bellanca's first-story gathering level. Merely repeating data and information or merely recalling and reciting are not really activities of higher-order thinking. Fogarty and Bellanca's first level is not treated in this book.

Learners move into higher-order thinking when they wrestle with the data and information in order to make some sense of it，when they compare and contrast，when they attempt to explain why，or when they categorize data and information. This level，which starts with Fogarty and Bellanca's second-story processing level，begins this book.

Generating Insight

The next，deeper step in higher-order thinking is called generating insight. There comes a time when learners have so adequately processed and so deeply grasped information that they are able to build their own insights directly related to the data. At this point，learners are generating ideas about the data and information that indicate that genuine understanding has been gained. In addition，learners may be taking the data and information one step further with such insights. At this time，perhaps the「Aha!」happens.

Discerning Implications

The final level is discerning implications. There is a time when the implications of the data and information become clear. That is，a learner begins to act，create，predict，judge，and evaluate the data and information. This is most akin to the third-story applying level suggested by Fogarty and Bellanca. Some teachers suggest that it is only at this stage that data and information really become a part of students' minds. Other teachers suggest that only now can students start having fun with the data and information that they have so laboriously comprehended. It is at this point that the real relevancy of data and information becomes clear and that students see connections between data and information and real life.

Figure Intro.2 shows fifteen higher-order thinking strategies arranged by category and by thinking level. This figure is meant to be a brief overview; each strategy is examined in the chapter that discusses its category and thinking level.

Figure Intro.2. Higher-order thinking skills matrix.

Strategy Techniques

Within each of the fifteen sections devoted to the specific thinking skills，two crucial teaching techniques are emphasized. One technique is to ask specific kinds of questions to help students become familiar with and strengthen that particular thinking skill. Posing these questions helps to guide students into recognizing and using a thinking skill.

The second technique is a graphic organizer that helps students to visualize how to use that particular thinking skill. By making a thinking skill visible in a graphic organizer，teachers enable students who do not automatically understand thinking skills to grasp their power. Teachers well versed in higher-order questioning and adept at these and other graphic organizers consistently will raise the level of higher-order thinking skills in their classrooms.

Many students find pictorial ways of organizing information extremely helpful in understanding and remembering content material. The graphic organizers shown in Figure Intro.3 are especially helpful as products for cooperative teams. Furthermore，when teachers want to emphasize a particular thinking skill，such as comparing and contrasting，analyzing，or sequencing，the graphic organizer linked with that thinking skill may be appropriate for their lesson. At least one graphic organizer is shown for each of the fifteen thinking skill areas outlined in this book.

Figure Intro.3. Graphic organizes for higher-order thinking skills.

About This Book

I invite you to peruse this book in any way you choose. You may like to start here and read to the finish. Or，you may want to target a particularly intriguing category and dig in there. This book is offered in the hopes that higher-order thinking skills will continue to blossom even more dramatically in our classrooms of the twenty-first century.

Each chapter treats one category of thinking skills. A chapter begins with a brief anecdote that illustrates the category，then discusses the skill，presents relevant life questions，and concludes by examining chosen strategies for the three thinking levels. Appendix A presents a brainstorming and lesson planning approach; Appendix B includes a blank copy of each of the graphic organizers presented in the text.

RELEVANCE

I was visiting my son and grandson near Philadelphia on a weekend before I had a workshop presentation in New Jersey. All three of us enjoyed a good time together. On our way to have Sunday brunch，my then five-year-old grandson asked,「Why do you have to go?」I replied,「I have work to do with 25 teachers over in New Jersey.」Very quickly he responded,「Then have them all come over here so you can stay.」My grandson's higher-order thinking took me aback. He had processed the information and come up with a very logical solution that honored my need to work with the teachers and his desire to have me stay longer. His higher-order thinking was definitely focused on relevance for himself. Relevance，in other words，was the spark for his leap in higher-order thinking.

About Relevance

There are three criteria that can help teachers gauge whether something is relevant to a student's thinking and to a student's life. First，can the situation，material，or learning connect with a student's emotions? Second，can the situation，material，or learning reveal some meaning or significance to the student? And，third，can the situation，material，or learning help to bring the student to a state of flow（Csikszentmihalyi，1990)? These three doorways—emotions，significance，and flow—can help students see that something is relevant to them and thereby prompt higher-order thinking.

THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS

Cognitive science has tried to understand higher-order thinking in many different ways. It has focused on cognitive processes as devoid of emotion（LeDoux，1996，p. 25). Many philosophers and contemporary psychologists have worked hard at distinguishing thinking and feeling，seeing them as very separate functions in the human mind（LeDoux，1996，p. 35). However，as Goleman reports:

Because so many of the brain's higher centers sprouted from or extended the scope of the limbic area，the emotional brain plays a crucial role in neural architecture. As the root from which the newer brain grew，the emotional areas are intertwined via myriad connecting circuits to all parts of the neocortex. This gives the emotional centers immense power to influence the functioning of the rest of the brain—including its centers for thought.（1995，p. 12)

Goleman makes it clear that there are many connections between emotion and thinking. Consequently，attempts at creating relevance that exclude emotion will have a very difficult task energizing higher-order thinking.

It stands to reason that appropriate involvement of emotion in the learning environment can enhance higher-order thinking. Sylwester furthers this line of thinking by suggesting that「We know emotion is very important to the educative process because it drives attention，which drives learning and memory」(1995，p. 72). In other words，emotions can be the very gateway to attention，which，in turn，becomes the gateway to learning and memory. The same can be said relative to higher-order thinking. Emotions are the gateway to attention，and attention，then，is the gateway to higher-order thinking.「All point to a simple truth：if one wants something to be attended to，mastered，and subsequently used，one must be sure to wrap it in a context that engages the emotions」(Gardner，2000，p. 77).

Emotions are the gateway to attention，and attention，then，is the gateway to higher-order thinking.

Although the effect of emotions on thinking has been emphasized，Elder and Paul complete the circle by suggesting that higher-order thinking can alter feelings. They say,「We must recognize that feelings are products of thinking，and that it is only through thinking that feelings become altered」(1997，p. 41). This research says that emotions are deeply interconnected to students' higher-order thinking and，furthermore，enable them to see the relevance in content material and，thus，enter into higher-order thinking.

THE IMPORTANCE OF MEANING

「Deep meaning refers to whatever drives us and governs our sense of purpose」(Caine & Caine，1997，p. 111). Therefore，another entry point into relevance is meaning. If the student cannot discern any meaning in the situation，material，or learning，then the student will not be motivated to think.

Caine and Caine also point out that our brains are constructed to「make sense of life experience」(1997，p. 118). The more teachers enable the brains of their students to find patterns and to make sense，the more they are facilitating their students ability to discern the relevance in situations，materials，and learning. Caine and Caine devoted two of their brain/mind learning principles to the importance of meaning:「Principle 3：The search for meaning is innate,」and「Principle 4：The search for meaning occurs through ‘patterning'」(1997，p. 19). They proposed that the brain is a meaning-creating organ. Creating meaning is one of its jobs. Students' thinking is intensified when they use their brains to create their own meaning out of material they have been given or have found. Thinking and memories are intensified when students have invested personal meaning in them（Sylwester，1995，p. 96). Caine and Caine note that when content material comes alive for a student—called dynamical knowledge by them—that「Dynamical knowledge is what we end up with as a result of our constructing our own meanings」(1997，p. 114). Consequently，meaning becomes crucial for generating a sense of relevance. That is，meaning becomes one pathway into higher-order thinking.

Students' thinking is intensified when they use their brains to create their own meaning out of material they have been given or have found.

THE IMPACT OF FLOW

Csikszentmihalyi（1990）introduced the concept of flow to describe a pleasing state of involvement relative to learning or working on a project or participating in a hobby.「When a learner experiences a state of flow，a creative oasis is reached，and the performer takes great pleasure in encountering the complexities of the task. The performer is free of frustration，fatigue，and futility. In fact，the performer has this feeling of intense enjoyment and joy in the performance of the skill」(Fogarty，1997，p. 131). When in this state，the person feels a passion for learning more or practicing a particular skill more completely. In fact，there is no stopping the student's capacity to absorb content material related to the topic that has captured his or her attention. Thought and feeling are merged at this point.

「Being able to enter flow is emotional intelligence at its best; flow represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in the service of performance and learning. In flow the emotions are not just contained and channeled，but positive，energized，and aligned with the task at hand」(Goleman，1995，p. 90). The tricky task for the teacher is to present a task with just the right amount of challenge so that the student has the possibility of entering flow.「If a task is too simple，it is boring; if too challenging，the result is anxiety rather than flow」(Goleman，1995，p. 93).

One of Caine and Caine's principles is that「complex learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by threat」(1997，p. 19). Although clearly the emotional state of the student has a direct impact on the possibility of flow，genuine flow is an optimum mixture of emotions and meaning. In other words，when an arena both beckons emotional involvement from and reveals a great deal of deep meaning for the student，then that student has the possibility of entering into the state of flow and engaging in thought-filled learning. Figure 1.1 shows this mix，which gives educators clues as to the potential for relevance as one facet leading to higher-order thinking.

Figure 1.1. Creating flow.

THE LIFE QUESTION

The concept of relevancy poses this life question for students：How do I make sense of who I am?

As learning directly connects a student with this life question，that student has the possibility of moving into higher-order thinking. If students do not see how higher-order thinking can help them make sense of who they are，then they are not motivated to stretch into higher-order thinking. This means that teachers need to be not only competent in the particular content area but also deeply aware of the life situations and complexities of the lives of their students.

Understanding Information—Skills of Comparing and Contrasting

Description of Strategy

Comparing and contrasting are two thinking skills that help students grasp whether information is relevant. How is this information linked with what they already understand? How is this information different from what they have been thinking or from what they have learned before? Comparing and contrasting take the ability to discern what the characteristics are of what is already known and what the characteristics are of what is being presented and to recognize their similarities or differences. It is these skills that enable a person to see connections between literary characters and the person's own characteristics and struggles or to decide which candidate to vote for in an election.

Comparing and contrasting are two thinking skills that help students grasp whether information is relevant.

Although this skill is vital to learning content material in school，it is also vital to the person walking down the street and noticing a gathering of people ahead. What does this person know already about benign gatherings of people? What does this person know already about the signs of danger in gatherings of people? How does that compare and/or contrast with what is just up ahead? The accuracy of the walker's higher-order thinking can make the difference between walking straight ahead into the group or crossing the street and avoiding the group altogether. In some cases，these skills can make the difference between safety and danger，even life and death.

Link to Relevance

In actuality，students are often comparing and contrasting. One reason that many students drop out of school is that they take information given to them in school and contrast that with their daily lives. When the contrast reveals no relevance to their daily lives，they discard the information. The challenge for teachers is to demonstrate how comparing and contrasting of content material can lead to a sense of deep relevance for the student.

Teaching Hints

Very often，the clue to linking data and information or stories to a student is through concepts and themes. A story written by Shakespeare reveals themes that every human struggles with. Getting too buried in the older English language，getting too overwhelmed with remembering what happened first and what happened next，or getting too pressured to recall myriads of characters may deter the student from seeing the real relevancy of the material. That is why using comparing and contrasting skills to reveal concepts，struggles，and themes that the student is currently experiencing can be the gateway to seeing the power of whatever content is being taught.

Questions

Comparing and contrasting are foundational skills for students. To help students discover links and differences，consider asking these kinds of questions:

How are two people alike and how are they different?

How is this character in the novel like you and how is he or she different?

How are you like this historical figure and how are you different?

How is this historical event like what just happened in x place yesterday?

How does this piece of information connect or disconnect with what you studied last week?

How is what you would do similar to or dissimilar to what this historical figure did?

Now that you have read these two novels or stories，why does one have more relevance to your life than the other?

The Graphic Organizer

The most popular graphic organizer to use for comparing and contrasting is a Venn diagram—two circles that overlap（Figure 1.2). In one circle，list the characteristics of the first item. In the other circle，list the characteristics of the second item. In the overlapping section，list common characteristics that each item has.

Figure 1.2. Comparing and contrasting by Venn diagram example.

Some teachers have created a Y figure（Figure 1.3），with the two contrasting characteristics above the Y and the common characteristics below the Y.

Figure 1.3. Comparing and contrasting using a Y example.

Generating Insight—Skills of Evaluating and Judging

Description of Strategy

Two thinking skills that help students in processing relevance are evaluating and judging. It is at this point that students insert their opinions and values into the data and information that they are working with. Having grasped some of the meaning of the information and using their personal thoughts，contexts，and values，students come up with very individual and personal insights. There is a weighing process that assumes a rich dialogue going on in the minds and hearts of students as they make personal decisions and judgments. In other words，this is not a process of taking data and information at face value but rather a process of examining behind，above，below，in between，and along side of the data and information and then connecting that examination not only with previous information but also with ongoing principles，values，and personal thoughts and opinions.

Link to Relevance

Merely understanding information is not enough to foster relevancy. Students need the skill of evaluating and judging to really determine whether there is meaning in the material for them personally. This demands getting intimate with the material—mixing one's own viewpoint，concerns，and desires with the material—to the point that understanding turns to grasping significance and meaning for one's own life.

Teaching Hints

Teachers cannot assume that their students，no matter what age level，come to them with developed thinking skills. Consequently，teachers need to teach thinking skills very directly and explicitly（Fogarty & Opeka，1988，p. i). Teachers need to break down the process of evaluating and judging so that they create a road map to successful evaluations and judgments for their students.

Teachers need to teach thinking skills very directly and explicitly（Fogarty & Opeka，1988，p. i).

Questions

Evaluating and judging are student activities whether done properly or not. To help students develop correct and useful ways to weigh things，people，and situations，consider asking students questions like this:

Which alternative makes more sense to you? Why does it make more sense to you?

Which approach will reach the most ethical resolution of this issue? Why?

What are the relevant values to keep in mind in order to settle this issue?

What are the consequences of doing x or doing y?

What are the relevant perspectives getting revealed?

What criteria are you using to make your judgments?

Graphic Organizer

Evaluating and judging have something to do with making a decision about options or getting clarity on the strengths and weaknesses or advantages and disadvantages of something. The graphic organizer shown in Figure 1.4 helps students either to examine a topic or situation in detail and see clearly the positives and negatives or to grasp the positives and negatives in two or more options. The ellipse on top of the options is a place to put the results of this evaluation and judgment. It is entirely possible that the contents of the ellipse could be a combination of elements in the two or three options.

Figure 1.4. Evaluating and judging example.

In addition to the graphic in Figure 1.4，a second visual representation that teachers could make of the process of evaluating and judging is to illuminate the steps that students already use when they make personal evaluations and judgments（for they are making those every day about many choices in their lives）by listing the steps on an overhead or a wall board.

Discerning Implications—Skill of Applying

Description of Strategy

When students have adequately understood information and have begun to spin off insights from that information，they are ready to apply the information to their own lives. Applying information involves the students' ability to pull out concepts，principles，ideas，and values and connect them to everyday life. This also requires that students have some ability to examine their own lives. In other words，applying information calls for a capacity to step back from the material and information to see what is valuable in it and to step back from everyday life enough to see its applicability. To do this，students need some grasp of where they are heading and what their particular needs are to get there. Students immersed in immediacy and the short term may have great difficulty in doing this. In other words，the skill of pulling principles，ideas，and values out of information is only half of the skill necessary for application. The other part of the skill is the ability to analyze and grasp what is going on in one's own life. Without students' ability to relate information to their own lives，teachers have plugs without sockets，so to speak.

Link to Relevance

The skill of applying is the crucial skill that finally makes material meaningful to students' everyday lives. Without this step，material may be interesting and intriguing，but not necessarily relevant. Many teachers observe that without this skill of applying，the material never really becomes permanently the student's own. Other teachers observe that this is when the learning has become fun. Without applying，there can be no impacting relevancy.

Without applying，there can be no impacting relevancy.

Teaching Hints

Applying is one of the hardest thinking skills to use. In general，students do not see connections between material studied and their own lives. Because of this，teachers need to present the steps of applying in order，thus helping students move，step-by-step，toward full applying. This is why it is so crucial to encourage students to articulate whatever perspectives，principles，or deep beliefs they hold. Getting students to articulate their real questions about life can lead them to discover relevant principles，values，and ideas in the material they are working with. Some students may need one-on-one work here. Other students will be able to do this introspection on their own or in the context of small group work.

Questions

Applying questions are particularly important to help students relate school content to their lives. Questions that foster application include these:

When have you encountered this issue in your own life?

When have you lost something dear to you?

How might you use this outside of this classroom?

What opportunities and challenges does this situation present?

Does might this approach really challenge or call into question how you have handled things so far? How?

What new direction is this calling you to consider?

Graphic Organizer

The graphic organizer shown in Figure 1.5 is particularly useful in helping students apply what they are learning to their personal lives. Students look at the data and concepts，pull out any principles，values，or ideas，and try to see any relevance among any of them to their own lives. One aid to students in doing this is for them to figure out what their own principles，values，beliefs，and life questions are. Many times，connections are not made because students are not really clear about where they are coming from or what personal goals they have.
