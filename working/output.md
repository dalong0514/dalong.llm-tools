The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) really came into existence with the birth of computers in and around the 1940s and 1950s. For the earlier period of its development, attention was clearly focused on getting computers to do things that, if a human did them, would be regarded as intelligent. Essentially, this involved trying to get computers to copy humans in some or all aspects of their behaviour. In the 1960s and 1970s this opened up a philosophical discussion as to just how close to a human brain a computer could be, and whether any differences that arose were really important. This period – referred to as ‘classical AI’ in this book – was, however, rather limited in its potential.  

人工智能（Artificial Intelligence，AI）领域随着 20 世纪 40 年代和 50 年代计算机的诞生而正式确立。在其发展初期，研究重点聚焦于使计算机具备那些若由人类完成即被视为智能的行为能力。本质上，这是试图让计算机在部分或全部行为特征上模仿人类。进入 20 世纪 60 年代后，这种技术探索引发了一场哲学思辨：计算机究竟能在多大程度上接近人脑？这些技术实现与生物智能的差异是否具有本质意义？本书所称的「经典 AI（classical AI）」时期虽然开启了相关探索，但其发展潜力存在明显局限。

In the 1980s and 1990s we saw a whole new approach, a sort of bottom-­up attack on the problem, effectively building artificial brains to bring about AI. This completely opened up the possibilities and created a whole new set of questions. No longer was AI restricted to merely copying human intelligence – now it could be intelligent in its own way. In some cases it could still be brought about by mimicking the way a human brain performed, but now it had the potential to be bigger, faster and better. The philosophical consequence of this was that now an artificial brain could potentially outperform a human brain.  

在 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代，研究者开创了一种全新的路径 —— 通过构建人工大脑实现人工智能（AI）的自下而上方法。这种方法彻底拓展了可能性空间，并引发了一系列新问题。此时的人工智能已不再局限于模仿人类智能，而是能够发展出独特的智能特征。虽然在某些领域仍可通过模拟人脑运作实现智能，但人工系统已展现出更强大、更快速、更优异的潜力。这种转变带来的哲学影响是：人工大脑在理论上具备超越人脑能力的可能性 [1]。

In more recent years the field has really taken off. Real-­world applications of AI, particularly in the finance, manufacturing and military sectors, are performing in ways with which the human brain simply cannot compete. Artificial brains are now being given their own body, with which to perceive the world in their own way and to move around in it and modify it as they see fit. They are being given the ability to learn, adapt and carry out their wishes with regard to humans. This raises all sorts of issues for the future.  

近年来，人工智能领域真正实现了突破性发展。AI 在现实场景的应用（特别是在金融、制造和军事领域）展现出远超人类大脑的能力。这些人工大脑如今被赋予了实体躯壳，能够以独特方式感知世界，在其中自主移动并按需改造环境。它们还获得了学习能力、适应性和实现目标的执行力，这种技术进步正在引发一系列关乎人类未来的深层议题。
